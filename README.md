This is the official repository of **CNN-based fast source device identification**,
submitted to [IEEE Signal Processing Letters](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=97) and currently available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.11847.pdf).


## Code
The code will be uploaded soon.


## Supplementary materials
In [supplementary_materials](supplementary_materials) you can find more detailed results. Precisely, [supplementary_materials.pdf](supplementary_materials/supplementary_materials.pdf) reports the list of results for the open-set problem, i.e., tackling source identification in case of unknown cameras. MATLAB .fig files used to generate these results are reported as well.
